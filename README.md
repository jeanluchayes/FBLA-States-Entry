Worked with a team of 2, using Unity 3d to develop and document a 3D first person shooter.

Received First Place at District competition
Received Fourth Place at State competition

I seem to have misplaced or deleted the original Source, and I am stil lookign for it. For now, I have the
windows build I submitted to FBLA, and that will be the release.
